<h3 align="left"> Sports puzzles game </h3>

[**Example of an app**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jigsaw-puzzles-puzzle-games/id1324604053?platform=iphone)

The starting wallet is equal to 500 coins. To open new pictures and collections, the user must earn coins by passing the available puzzles.  

Depending on the selected difficulty level, the amount of winnings changes. The level of difficulty depends on the number of puzzle pieces, into which the selected picture is divided.  
After the user collects the whole picture, there is a pop up with the ability to double the number of won coins by watching ads. 
There is a function to add your own pictures and collect them in the form of puzzles. 
There is a store with the ability to buy coins and hints by watching ads using UnityAds.   
Tab bar is implemented using FXPageControl, allowing the user to move smoothly between screens.

<h3 align="left">Football Stats apps </h3>

[**Example of an apps**](https://apps.apple.com/by/app/sofascore-live-score-app/id1176147574)  


I made three apps for viewing match schedules:
* App allows user to monitor matches from most of the football leagues worldwide with division on past/live/upcoming games using api-football as a source of data. User has opportunity to predict the score and save it by applying selection on match details screen. User can also view football news that was taken from the api newsdata.io.
* Another application for viewing match schedules, where the user can save his guesses about the score of the game. Matches can be searched and filtered by date. It is also possible to view by date the matches where the user's guesses are saved. In the match details, depending on the status of the match, you can make guesses, view match statistics, team comparisons, club table and the positioning of players on the field. Charts is used to display a pie chart of statistics. On a separate screen you can see information about the top 10 clubs. Match information is used from transfermarket.p.rapidapi.com.
* It is also an application for viewing match schedules, with the ability to save game score guesses. 
Unlike previous applications, the user can leave notes for each match. It also displays match guesses taken from the api and on a separate screen there is a rating of players. 
For swiping matches cells I implemented a custom carousel animation.
Match information is used from api-football.


**Apps created using:** UIKit +  SOLID + MVVM + CoreData.
